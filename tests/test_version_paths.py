"""No tool writes the pinned Minecraft version by hand: every path comes from the lock file.

`tools/lab.py` says it: "The Minecraft version research-lock.json pins: every tool reads it from
there, never by hand." A path that spells the version out breaks on the next version bump, and
nothing catches it, because the tools that break are the ones that need the vanilla data to run.

The few places that name a version on purpose (a tool that compares two versions, tests with a lock file of their own) are
listed in ALLOWED, each with the reason.
