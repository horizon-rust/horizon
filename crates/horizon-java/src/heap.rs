//! The native backend's heap (docs/java-compat/compiler.md 4.3): one range
//! of address space reserved at a fixed place, handed out in chunks to each
//! thread's allocation buffer.
//!
//! Every thread that runs compiled code has a [`Context`]: its buffer (the
//! next free byte and its end), the exception it is throwing, and a safe
//! point flag. Compiled code gets it as its first, hidden argument and
//! allocates by bumping the buffer; when the buffer runs out, [`refill`]
//! takes a new chunk from the heap with one atomic add. The heap knows every
//! thread's context, for the collector and for saving the heap after the
//! game's setup ran (a snapshot loads back at the same address, so the
//! pointers in it need no fixing).
