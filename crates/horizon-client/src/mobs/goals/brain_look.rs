use super::*;

/// `RandomLookAround`, the brain behaviour `CamelAi` and `ArmadilloAi` use,
/// which is not the goal of that name: every `interval` ticks it looks at
/// most `max_yaw` degrees off the body's yaw, at a pitch in the range, and
/// `LookAtTargetSink` keeps the head turning there for 45 to 90 ticks.
///
/// It holds `LOOK`: vanilla's behaviour starts only while `LOOK_TARGET` is
/// absent, and a temptation or a player to look at sets that memory, so a
/// higher `LOOK` goal (`Tempt`, `LookAtPlayer`) keeps it from starting and
/// stops the held look. `CountDownCooldownTicks` runs in the core activity
/// whatever looks, so the cooldown is the mob age it ends at and keeps
/// running while the goal is stopped.
