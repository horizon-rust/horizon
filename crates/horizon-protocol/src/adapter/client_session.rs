//! One connection from a client of an older release to a Horizon server: [`super::Session`] run the other
//! way (roadmap `older-clients`). What the client sends is renumbered to the pinned ids before the server
//! reads it; what the server sends is renumbered to the client's, registry ids included, with a stand-in
//! ([`ids::Substitutes`]) for a block, item, entity, particle or sound the client's version lacks.
//!
//! This layer maps ids; the world packets whose layout changed between 26.2 and the pinned release are
//! written in 26.2's layout by [`world`]. Serverbound, 26.2's `accept_teleportation`, `player_action` and
//! `swing` are read as 26.3's (the mirror of `translate`'s writers); other packets whose layout changed
//! still pass in the pinned layout.
//!
//! The states change where vanilla's server-side `Connection` switches its codecs, after the handshake the
//! server read itself: `login_acknowledged` and `login_finished` move each direction to configuration,
//! `finish_configuration` to play, and `configuration_acknowledged` / `start_configuration` back.
