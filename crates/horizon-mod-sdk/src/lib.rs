//! Write Horizon mods in Rust (`docs/mods.md`).
//!
//! A mod is a type implementing [`Mod`], exported with [`export_mod!`] from
//! a `cdylib` crate built for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`;
//! `cargo horizon-mod build` turns it into the component the game loads.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use horizon_mod_sdk::{Mod, Registration, chat};
//!
//! struct Hello;
//! impl Mod for Hello {
//!     fn init() -> Result<(Self, Registration), String> {
//!         Ok((Hello, Registration::new().command("hello")))
//!     }
//!     fn command(&mut self, _name: &str, _args: &str) -> Result<Option<String>, String> {
//!         chat::show("Hello from a mod!");
//!         Ok(None)
//!     }
//! }
//! horizon_mod_sdk::export_mod!(Hello);
//! ```
//!
//! Every interface but `log` is a capability: list the ones the mod uses in
//! `horizon-mod.toml` (`game-read`, `chat`, `hud`, `storage`, `command`, `ui`;
//! a server mod `storage` and `players`). Server mods: [`server`].
//!
//! Widgets (capability `ui`): a mod shows a screen it owns with
//! [`ui::open_screen`] and a page in Options > Mods with
//! [`ui::set_settings`]; what the player does with them comes back as
//! [`Mod::ui_select`], [`Mod::ui_closed`] and [`Mod::ui_settings_opened`].
//! A screen the mod lays out itself (capability `gui-screens`):
//! [`gui_screens::open`] with its own panel, background and widgets in the
//! panel's coordinates; the player's clicks come back as
//! [`Mod::gui_clicked`], [`Mod::gui_picked`] and [`Mod::gui_closed`].
