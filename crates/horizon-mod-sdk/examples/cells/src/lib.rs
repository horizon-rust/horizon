//! Example Horizon server mod (`docs/mods.md`, "Block entities", "Energy")
//! with capabilities `block-entities` and `energy`: every lodestone a player
//! places becomes an energy cell, an energy buffer any mod's machine can
//! fill or drain — and so does the mod's own cell block, `cells:cell`,
//! declared in its package's content (capability `registries`,
//! `data/cells/horizon/block/cell.json`): a lodestone's behaviour under the
//! mod's own id. A cell charges itself each tick, shares its energy with the
//! cells beside it, and keeps it in the world's save; breaking one says what
//! was lost. `/cell [pos]` reads the cell under the player (or at `pos`);
//! `/cellgui [pos]`, or a right click on the cell, opens its menu
//! (capability `menus`): its charge, kept up to date, and buttons to drain
//! or fill it. Above each cell floats its charge, a small redstone core
//! spins, and four nether stars circle it — item displays shown once and
//! then only moved (capability `displays`); a sentinel carries a star of
//! its own above its head, riding the golem wherever it walks. Each cell
//! has two slots (capability
//! `items`), shown in its menu: redstone put in the left one turns into
//! energy, and the menu's Drain button turns energy into redstone in the
//! right one, which players can only take from. A cobblestone or andesite
//! in the left slot is ground into redstone by the mod's own machine
//! recipes (capability `machine-recipes`, `data/cells/recipe/`), which the
//! game loads before the mod starts; `/cellrecipes` counts them. Its
//! energy core is a multiblock (capability `multiblocks`,
//! `data/cells/multiblock/`): a ring of iron around the cell, watched from
//! its first tick, so the game tells when it comes together and when it no
//! longer holds; a standing core charges its cell ten times over, and
//! `/cellcore` says it is whole or names the first block it needs. Its
//! power grids (capability `saved-data`) are data on the world itself:
//! `/cellnet <name>` joins the cell under the player to a grid, `/cellnet`
//! lists them; a grid goes when its last cell does, and a restart of the
//! mod loses nothing. It takes half of every blow a player is about to
//! take, keeps its cells from being broken and lets redstone be picked up
//! only with the energy staff in hand, and is told of what players drop
//! and what the server spawns (capability `rich-events`). Its energy staff (capability `item-hooks`) is a
//! blaze rod in the main hand: `/staff` reads its charge, a use spends it,
//! a blow with it deals twice over, a click or a tick on a cell moves
//! energy between the two, and a golden helmet worn takes a hurt a share
//! at a time — their charge is the mod's own bytes on the stack, saved
//! with it wherever it goes.
