/// 0.2's rules, after the introduction.
const RULES_0_2: &str = "\
**Experimental** ([stability.md](stability.md)): `horizon-shader check` takes 0.2 packs, the game draws them only
with `HORIZON_HDR_FRAME=float` set, the registry doesn't list them, and anything here may change in any release.
The design: [hdr-linear-light.md](../design/hdr-linear-light.md).

## Colour

Every colour a 0.2 stage reads or returns is **linear light**: BT.709 (sRGB) primaries by default, scene-referred,
1.0 is vanilla's white at paper white, more is brighter. A pack may ask for BT.2020 primaries, which hold colours
outside sRGB, with `[frame] primaries` (below). Horizon decodes vanilla's values with a 2.2 power (vanilla's, not
the piecewise sRGB curve), replacing negatives and NaN with 0 first, and encodes a stage's result the same way where
the frame stores gamma (`[frame] blend`, below).

- **Linear:** `MaterialInput` `albedo`, `tint`, `lightmap` and `colored_light`; `VertexInput.tint`; `SkyInput.color`;
  `WeatherInput.color`; `Frame` `sky_color` and `fog_color`; `block_texture`, `block_texture_level` and
  `block_light_color`; `RayHit` `albedo` and `tint`; every colour texture a stage samples (`scene_color`, `previous`,
  `history`, the pack's targets, `opaque_color`, `reflection`, `shadow_color`).
- **Data, as in 0.1:** depth, normals, `light` levels, `emission`, every channel of the LabPBR maps, and the pack's
  `[[textures]]`.
- **`[[lights]]` and `[[particle_lights]]` colours** are written as in 0.1, in vanilla's gamma, and Horizon decodes
  them: `block_light_color` and `colored_light` are linear. `block_light_colors` holds them as written; read it through
  `block_light_color`.
- **Alpha is coverage only**, never light: brightness is in rgb alone. A post pass's alpha is ignored.

## Room to grow

`Frame`, the stage inputs (`SkyInput`, `VertexInput`, `MaterialInput`, `DisplacementInput`, `WeatherInput`,
`PostInput`, `TonemapInput`, `EntityInput`), `surface_at`'s `SurfaceData` and `trace`'s `RayHit` may gain fields in later
releases. Read their fields and pass them along, but don't construct them: `horizon-shader check` refuses
`PostInput(...)` and the like. `Surface` is yours to construct and keeps its one field; later material outputs come as
helpers.

**New names reach a stage only if the pack asked for them.** A later release puts a new name before your files (a
helper, a struct, a resource, a constant) only under a manifest key the pack sets, or in a stage added later, whose
prelude is its own. A stage a pack has today keeps the names it has today, so a name of your own that is free now
stays yours: an addition doesn't break a pack that didn't ask for it. Names starting with `horizon_` are Horizon's
already, and new fields can't collide, since you don't construct those structs.

## The display

`frame.hdr`, `headroom`, `paper_white`, `peak` and `black_level` describe the display, read again every frame. With HDR
on, where the device keeps the HUD on a layer of its own, a 0.2 pack sees the display's: `hdr` 1, `paper_white` and
`peak` in nits, `headroom` the peak over paper white (at least 1) and `black_level` the display's black in nits.
Otherwise it sees SDR: `hdr` 0, `headroom` 1, `paper_white` and `peak` 80, `black_level` 0, and its picture ends on an
8-bit frame, clipped at white, before the camera overlays and the HUD draw. Horizon lifts the shadows onto
`black_level` after `[tonemap]`: read it, but don't apply it.

## `[frame] blend`

`blend = \"gamma\"` (the default) keeps the frame in vanilla's gamma, values above 1 kept: Horizon encodes the material,
sky and weather stages' results before they are stored and blended, so glass, water, clouds and particles blend as
vanilla's. `blend = \"linear\"` stores linear light, so see-through draws blend as light does: Horizon stores those
stages' results as they are and decodes its own draws (entities, particles, clouds, weather, the stages a pack leaves
out), so a solid surface looks as under `\"gamma\"`. A stage sees the same values either way. Where the device can't
draw a float frame the pack draws on an 8-bit one, in gamma. Under `\"linear\"` resource packs' `core/sky`,
`core/stars` and `core/rendertype_lines` shaders, which write gamma, give way to Horizon's own sky, stars and block
outline.

## `[frame] primaries`

`primaries = \"bt709\"` (the default) is the rule above. With `primaries = \"bt2020\"` every colour a stage reads or
returns is in BT.2020 primaries instead (D65 white, 1.0 still vanilla's white at paper white, values never negative).
It needs `blend = \"linear\"`, since a change of primaries is only right in linear light. `frame.primaries` says which
space the pack's colours are in, and `frame.luminance` holds that space's luminance weights: compute luminance as
`dot(color, frame.luminance)` and it is right in either. `\"bt2020\"` passes the check; the game doesn't serve it yet.

/// 0.2's `[ray_tracing]`, at the end of the post stage.
fn ray_tracing() -> String {
    let mut out = String::from(
        "### Ray tracing\n\n\
         With `[ray_tracing]` in the manifest (it has no keys, and needs a `[[post]]` pass or a `[material]` stage) the post\n\
         stage's prelude also has `RayHit` and the functions and constants below, so does the material stage's where its\n\
         files name one of the four trace functions, and the `Frame` of every stage of the pack has `has_ray_tracing` and\n\
         `ray_distance`. A pack without the key has none of them, and a material stage that names no trace function is\n\
         built as without it.\n\n\
         The game traces for the pack picked when it starts: only then, and only for a pack with `[ray_tracing]`, does it\n\
         ask the GPU for hardware ray queries, where the GPU and graphics API have them. In a game started without them a\n\
         pack picked while it runs traces from the next start, and the shader pack screen says so. `HORIZON_RAY_TRACING=1`\n\
         asks for ray queries and keeps the scene with any pack or none; any other value of it turns ray tracing off.\n\n\
         - `fn trace(origin: vec3<f32>, direction: vec3<f32>, max_distance: f32) -> RayHit`: the nearest solid surface\n  \
         from `origin` (camera-relative, in blocks, as `view_position` gives it) along the unit vector `direction`, within\n  \
         `max_distance` blocks.\n\
         - `fn trace_any(origin: vec3<f32>, direction: vec3<f32>, max_distance: f32) -> bool`: whether any solid surface\n  \
         is in the way: a shadow ray, which stops at the first it finds and reads nothing of it.\n\
         - `const RAY_SOLID: u32`, `const RAY_TRANSLUCENT: u32`: the scene's two layers, bits to OR together. Solid\n  \
         terrain, with cut-outs (leaves, plants) and lava; and what the translucent pass draws: water, glass, stained\n  \
         glass, ice, slime and honey blocks, any block whose texture has partly see-through texels.\n\
         - `fn trace_layers(origin: vec3<f32>, direction: vec3<f32>, max_distance: f32, layers: u32) -> RayHit` and\n  \
         `fn trace_any_layers(origin: vec3<f32>, direction: vec3<f32>, max_distance: f32, layers: u32) -> bool`: `trace`\n  \
         and `trace_any` over the layers `layers` names; `trace(o, d, m)` is `trace_layers(o, d, m, RAY_SOLID)`. With no\n  \
         layer named every ray misses.\n\
         - `fn hit_normal_map(hit: RayHit) -> vec4<f32>`, `fn hit_specular_map(hit: RayHit) -> vec4<f32>`: the resource\n  \
         packs' LabPBR maps at the hit, its sprite's texel at `hit.uv` at full size, as `block_normal_map_level(uv, 0.0)`\n  \
         and `block_specular_map_level(uv, 0.0)` read a drawn surface's; their defaults without maps, and on a miss.\n\
         - In the post stage, `fn block_pbr_maps() -> bool`: whether the resource packs ship LabPBR maps, as the material\n  \
         stage's.\n\n\
         A ray starts at `origin` itself, so move a point off its own surface before tracing from it. What stops it is what\n\
         the surface's own pass draws. In the solid layer it passes through the clear texels of a cut-out texture (leaves,\n\
         plants), as terrain's alpha test does: a texel stops it from alpha 0.5 up. In the translucent layer every texel\n\
         stops it, however faint, except a clear one (alpha below 0.01), which the translucent pass doesn't draw either;\n\
         the hit's `albedo.a` is the texel's alpha and its `translucent` is true. A ray over both layers stops at the\n\
         nearest surface of either: to go on through a translucent one, trace again from just behind the hit. The scene is\n\
         Horizon's: the terrain around the camera, out to `frame.ray_distance` at least, without entities, particles,\n\
         clouds or distant terrain. While\n\
         the game doesn't trace (`frame.has_ray_tracing` is 0) the pack is built and runs all the same, and every ray\n\
         misses. Your files name no ray query of their own (`ray_query`, `acceleration_structure`, `RayDesc`,\n\
         `RayIntersection`, a `rayQuery` function, `enable wgpu_ray_query`): the check refuses them, and an `output`\n\
         named as one of these functions.\n\n\
         In the material stage only `material` traces: `displacement` and the vertex stage's `vertex`, whose files share\n\
         its module, run in vertex shaders, and the check refuses a pack where either reaches a trace function.\n\
         `material` runs for every terrain fragment drawn, so a ray costs more there than in a post pass: keep its rays for\n\
         translucent surfaces (`input.translucent`), which leave no surface for a post pass to light.\n\n",

         has one. Both names are free WGSL names, as an `output`'s, and no word WGSL reserves.\n\
         - `[[before_world]]`: a compute pass once a frame, before the world draws: `file`, `dispatch` (`[x, y, z]`\n  \
         cells, or `\"pixels\"`, one per texel of the render size), `workgroup = [x, y, z]`, `reads` and `writes`.\n\

         it doesn't list is the file's own, and using such a resource is refused as unlisted. The check also refuses a\n\
         compute pass that writes a texture and reads it back (read `_previous`, or a buffer), and a pass that reads its\n\
         own `output`.\n\n\
         A compute file defines `fn compute(input: ComputeInput)`, and Horizon adds the `@compute` entry with the pass's\n\

/// The entity stage's notes, after its input: what it returns, and vanilla's own.
const ENTITY_NOTES: &str = "\
`entity` lights what is no block terrain: `input.kind` says which. It returns the same `Surface` as `material` (rgb
linear light, 0 or more and unbounded; alpha its coverage), so a pack writes its lighting once and calls it from both
stages. Around it Horizon keeps vanilla's order: the alpha test on the returned alpha, then the enchantment glint
added on top, then fog. `horizon-shader check` takes the stage; **the game doesn't draw it yet** and refuses a pack
that has it. A pack without `[entity]` is drawn as before, and sees none of this stage's names. Until the game draws
the stage its prelude may still gain names; from then on the rule for new names holds for it too.

Vanilla's own, the picture a pack without the stage gets:

```wgsl
fn entity(input: EntityInput) -> Surface {
    let base = input.albedo.rgb * input.tint.rgb * input.shade;
    // Vanilla lays the flash over the surface in its gamma (the 2.2 power), before the light.
    let gamma = vec3<f32>(1.0 / 2.2);
    let flashed = pow(mix(pow(base, gamma), pow(input.overlay.rgb, gamma), input.overlay.a), vec3<f32>(2.2));
    return Surface(vec4<f32>(flashed * input.lightmap, input.albedo.a * input.tint.a));
}
```

Without a flash (`overlay.a` 0) that is `albedo * tint * shade * lightmap`. In linear light alone,
`mix(base, input.overlay.rgb, input.overlay.a) * input.lightmap` is the same flash a little brighter. The shade and
the light act on rgb only. `lightmap` holds no coloured light: where `colored_light` is above 0, Horizon's own draw
adds it to the light colour, and the expression above leaves it out.
