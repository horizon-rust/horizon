//! The block entities the renderer keeps on the GPU (a closed chest, a shulker box, a bell, a
//! decorated pot, a banner: `StaticSectionSnapshot`) in the ray scene's entity layer (spec
//! #16011 item 3, step 3), while it has the layer. Their draws read a vertex buffer a section,
//! which rays can't; the layer copies each section's quads into a store of its own, in the
//! stream's layout (`Vertex`), and builds the section a BLAS from them, as terrain has. A
//! section's BLAS is built again only when its quads change (its snapshot's revision: a chest
//! that opens moves to the stream, and back when it closes), and goes when its block entities
//! do or it leaves the scene's reach. Its instance is in the TLAS after the stream's, mask
//! `RAY_ENTITY`, its custom data its first quad in the store: a hit on an instance from
//! `RayScene::retained_instances` on reads the store (`RAY_ENTITY_RETAINED_BINDING`), the stream's reads the
//! stream.
