//! The terrain as acceleration structures, with ray tracing on (#13780 step 2, after the #1180
//! spike; `ray_query`): within `reach` chunks of the camera one BLAS per section's solid quads
//! and one per its translucent quads (`Layer`), compacted once built, and one TLAS of them,
//! built again only when a BLAS changes or the camera enters another chunk column (its instances
//! sit relative to that column). A shader pack's `trace` reads them (`traced`,
//! gfx/native_trace.rs). Without ray queries on the device there is no scene and nothing here
//! runs.
//!
//! The scene keeps every such section's quads as vertices (`TerrainVertex`) in one store that
//! lasts from frame to frame (spec #15624): the BLAS are built from it, and a ray that hits a
//! triangle reads that triangle's vertices there. A TLAS instance's custom data is its quads'
//! first in the store. The unpack pass (`Unpacker`, `rt_unpack.wgsl`) writes a section's solid
//! quads into their slot (`Slots`) as the solid draws read them, from a record or a vertex, so
//! the section arena keeps its compact layout. A full store grows: the larger one gets the old
//! contents copied over, so every slot keeps its place and no BLAS is built again.
//!
//! The two layers are told apart twice (spec #16011): by their instances' masks, so a ray's
//! cull mask picks the layers it reads, and by their place in the TLAS, the solid instances
//! first, so a hit's instance index says which layer it is in (`Traced::solid_instances`).
//! Translucent quads are vertices in their arena already, in the mesher's order: drawing sorts
//! them back to front through an index list of its own (gfx/translucency.rs), which the scene
//! never reads, so a camera that moves builds nothing here. Their vertices are copied into the
//! store as they are.
//!
//! For a pack whose files name `RAY_ENTITY` the scene has a third layer, the entities within its
//! reach (spec #16011 item 3, `Entities`): one BLAS over the entity stream's quads that the batch
//! marked, read from its vertex buffer as it is, its instance after the translucent ones. It is
//! built again every frame, after the stream's upload, so the TLAS is too. Its third geometry is
//! the entities the camera doesn't draw (step 2): the game moves them out of what the camera
//! draws (`Renderer::take_ray_only`), and the batch puts them where no pass draws from.
