# Shader API reference (0.2)

Generated from `crates/horizon-shader-api` (`HORIZON_WRITE_DOCS=1 cargo test -p horizon-shader-api --test reference`
rewrites it; the test fails when it drifts). The API's design and pack format: [shaders.md](shaders.md).

**Experimental** ([stability.md](stability.md)): `horizon-shader check` takes 0.2 packs, the game draws them and
the registry lists them, and anything here may change in any release.
The design: [hdr-linear-light.md](../design/hdr-linear-light.md).

## Colour

Every colour a 0.2 stage reads or returns is **linear light**: BT.709 (sRGB) primaries by default, scene-referred,
1.0 is vanilla's white at paper white, more is brighter. A pack may ask for BT.2020 primaries, which hold colours
outside sRGB, with `[frame] primaries` (below). Horizon decodes vanilla's values with a 2.2 power (vanilla's, not
the piecewise sRGB curve), replacing negatives and NaN with 0 first, and encodes a stage's result the same way where
the frame stores gamma (`[frame] blend`, below).

- **Linear:** `MaterialInput` `albedo`, `tint`, `lightmap` and `colored_light`; `VertexInput.tint`; `SkyInput.color`;
  `WeatherInput.color`; `Frame` `sky_color` and `fog_color`; `block_texture`, `block_texture_level` and
  `block_light_color`; `RayHit` `albedo` and `tint`; every colour texture a stage samples (`scene_color`, `previous`,
  `history`, the pack's targets, `opaque_color`, `reflection`, `shadow_color`).
- **Data:** depth, normals, `light` levels, `emission`, every channel of the LabPBR maps, and the pack's
  `[[textures]]`.
- **`[[lights]]` and `[[particle_lights]]` colours** are written in vanilla's gamma, and Horizon decodes
  them: `block_light_color` and `colored_light` are linear. `block_light_colors` holds them as written; read it through
  `block_light_color`.
- **Alpha is coverage only**, never light: brightness is in rgb alone. A post pass's alpha is ignored.

## Room to grow

`Frame`, the stage inputs (`SkyInput`, `VertexInput`, `MaterialInput`, `DisplacementInput`, `WeatherInput`,
`PostInput`, `TonemapInput`, `EntityInput`), `surface_at`'s `SurfaceData` and `trace`'s `RayHit` may gain fields in later
releases. Read their fields and pass them along, but don't construct them: `horizon-shader check` refuses
`PostInput(...)` and the like. `Surface` is yours to construct and keeps its one field; later material outputs come as
helpers.

**New names reach a stage only if the pack asked for them.** A later release puts a new name before your files (a
helper, a struct, a resource, a constant) only under a manifest key the pack sets, or in a stage added later, whose
prelude is its own. A stage a pack has today keeps the names it has today, so a name of your own that is free now
stays yours: an addition doesn't break a pack that didn't ask for it. Names starting with `horizon_` are Horizon's
already, and new fields can't collide, since you don't construct those structs.

## The display

`frame.hdr`, `headroom`, `paper_white`, `peak` and `black_level` describe the display, read again every frame. With HDR
on, where the device keeps the HUD on a layer of its own, a 0.2 pack sees the display's: `hdr` 1, `paper_white` and
`peak` in nits, `headroom` the peak over paper white (at least 1) and `black_level` the display's black in nits.
Otherwise it sees SDR: `hdr` 0, `headroom` 1, `paper_white` and `peak` 80, `black_level` 0, and its picture ends on an
8-bit frame, clipped at white, before the camera overlays and the HUD draw. Horizon lifts the shadows onto
`black_level` after `[tonemap]`: read it, but don't apply it.

## `[frame] blend`

`blend = "gamma"` (the default) keeps the frame in vanilla's gamma, values above 1 kept: Horizon encodes the material,
sky and weather stages' results before they are stored and blended, so glass, water, clouds and particles blend as
vanilla's. `blend = "linear"` stores linear light, so see-through draws blend as light does: Horizon stores those
stages' results as they are and decodes its own draws (entities, particles, clouds, weather, the stages a pack leaves
out), so a solid surface looks as under `"gamma"`. A stage sees the same values either way. Where the device can't
draw a float frame the pack draws on an 8-bit one, in gamma. Under `"linear"` resource packs' `core/sky`,
`core/stars` and `core/rendertype_lines` shaders, which write gamma, give way to Horizon's own sky, stars and block
outline.

## `[frame] primaries`

`primaries = "bt709"` (the default) is the rule above. With `primaries = "bt2020"` every colour a stage reads or
returns is in BT.2020 primaries instead (D65 white, 1.0 still vanilla's white at paper white, values never negative).
It needs `blend = "linear"`, since a change of primaries is only right in linear light. `frame.primaries` says which
space the pack's colours are in, and `frame.luminance` holds that space's luminance weights: compute luminance as
`dot(color, frame.luminance)` and it is right in either. `"bt2020"` passes the check; the game doesn't serve it yet.

A stage is a function your WGSL defines, with the signature below; Horizon puts the prelude (these structs, the
resources and helpers) before your files and calls the function from its own pass. Your files declare no
bindings and no entry points, and no names starting with `horizon_`.

## Stages

| Stage | In `horizon-shaders.toml` | Your function |
| --- | --- | --- |

### `VertexInput`

One corner of a block's surface, for `fn vertex(input: VertexInput) -> vec3<f32>`, which returns where it is drawn (camera-relative, in blocks; `input.position` where it stays).

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `position` | `vec3<f32>` | The corner, camera-relative, in blocks (`+ frame.camera_position` for the world's). |
| `uv` | `vec2<f32>` | The texture coordinate inside the block's sprite. |
| `material` | `u32` | The `[[materials]]` id of the block's sprite (0 when none matches). |
| `light` | `vec2<f32>` | Block and sky light, 0..1. |

| `fluid` | `u32` | 1 on a fluid's surface (water or lava), else 0. |

Resources (bind group 3):

  stored in the shadow map, for `textureSampleCompareLevel`.
- `fn shadow_distort(xy: vec2<f32>) -> vec2<f32>`: the map's distortion of a point at shadow clip `xy`.

## material

`fn material(input: MaterialInput) -> Surface`

### `MaterialInput`

One point of a block's surface, for `fn material(input: MaterialInput) -> Surface`.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `albedo` | `vec4<f32>` | The block texture's colour here (alpha 0..1). |
| `tint` | `vec4<f32>` | The vertex colour: biome tint, face shade and ambient occlusion. |
| `light` | `vec2<f32>` | Block and sky light, 0..1, smoothed over the face. |
| `lightmap` | `vec3<f32>` | Vanilla's light colour for that light this frame. |
| `position` | `vec3<f32>` | The point, camera-relative, in blocks. |
| `uv` | `vec2<f32>` | The texture coordinate inside the block atlas. |
| `translucent` | `bool` | Drawn in the translucent pass (water, stained glass, ice). |
| `tags` | `u32` | The pack's sprite tags this surface's sprite has: bit i for the manifest's i-th `[[tags]]`. |
| `material` | `u32` | The `[[materials]]` id of this surface's sprite (0 when no entry names it). |
| `screen` | `vec2<f32>` | Where the point is on the screen, 0..1 from the top left (`opaque_depth` and `opaque_color` at `screen * frame.resolution`). |
| `face` | `u32` | For a fluid, which face of the block the point is on, `Direction` order: 0 down, 1 up, 2 north, 3 south, 4 west, 5 east. 0 elsewhere. |
| `fluid` | `u32` | 0 not a fluid, 1 water, 2 lava. |
| `emission` | `f32` | How strongly the block itself shines, 0..1, by its kind of light: a redstone torch or a candle 7/15, a torch or lava 14/15, glowstone 1; 0 for most blocks. |
| `normal` | `vec3<f32>` | The surface's geometric normal, a unit vector in world axes, facing the camera. A normal within about 3.6 degrees of an axis is that axis exactly, so distant block faces do not shimmer; flowing water's slopes are steeper and keep theirs. |
| `tangent` | `vec4<f32>` | The surface's tangent: xyz the unit direction in world axes along which `uv.x` grows, w the sign (1 or -1) that makes `cross(normal, tangent.xyz) * tangent.w` the direction `uv.y` grows along (down the texture). With `normal` it turns a normal map's normals into world axes. |
| `colored_light` | `vec3<f32>` | The frame's coloured lights at this point (`[[particle_lights]]`, held and dropped items in their `[[lights]]` colour while dynamic lights are on, and mods' visual lights), 0..1, to light the surface with as the pack likes; 0 where none reaches. |
| `displaced` | `f32` | How much of the relief `[displacement]` gave this point as geometry, 0..1: 1 near the camera, where the surface already lies where `displacement` put it (`position` is that point; a parallax effect would count its depth twice), easing to 0 at `[displacement] distance`; always 0 without `[displacement]`. |

### `Surface`

What `material` returns. Vanilla's own is `albedo * tint * vec4(lightmap, 1.0)`; Horizon then applies the alpha test (cutout and translucent) and fog.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `color` | `vec4<f32>` | The lit colour: rgb linear light, 0 or more and unbounded (more than 1 is brighter than white); alpha its coverage. |

Under `[displacement]` the stage also defines `fn displacement(input: DisplacementInput) -> f32`, called for each corner of the grid the faces near the camera are cut into; the corner moves along the face's normal by the depth it gives at the point's height less the depth at the texture's mean height, pinned at the face's edges and easing out over the last quarter of the distance.

### `DisplacementInput`

One corner of the grid a block face near the camera is cut into, for `fn displacement(input: DisplacementInput) -> f32` (`[displacement]`), which returns how deep below the face, in blocks, the surface lies at `height`.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `position` | `vec3<f32>` | The corner on the flat face, camera-relative, in blocks. |
| `normal` | `vec3<f32>` | The face's normal, a unit vector in world axes. |
| `uv` | `vec2<f32>` | The texture coordinate inside the block's sprite (as `MaterialInput.uv`). |
| `material` | `u32` | The `[[materials]]` id of the block texture (0 when none matches). |
| `height` | `f32` | A LabPBR height, 0..1 (1 the top of the relief): the normal map's alpha here, or the texture's average height (what the face's edges are pinned to). |

Resources (bind group 3):

| Binding | Declaration | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `var<uniform> frame: Frame` | The frame (`Frame`). |
| 1 | `var reflection: texture_2d<f32>` | The water mirror: the world as a camera mirrored about the horizontal water plane around the camera (`frame.water_plane`) sees it, at half resolution, mapped like the world's picture, so water samples it at `input.screen`. Solid terrain, cut away below the plane, over the vanilla sky gradient: not the pack's `sky` stage, nor the sun, moon and stars. Drawn only for a pack whose material reads it, while `frame.has_reflection` is 1; else a 1×1 blank. |
| 2 | `var reflection_sampler: sampler` | Bilinear filtering, clamped to the edges. |
| 3 | `var shadow_map: texture_depth_2d` | This frame's shadow map: the depth of the solid terrain and entities the light sees, 0 at the light, 1 away from it (and where nothing is), stored at `shadow_position`'s mapping. Valid while `frame.has_shadow` is 1 (the pack asks for it with `[shadow]`), else a 1×1 map that lights everything. |
| 4 | `var shadow_sampler: sampler_comparison` | Depth comparison, bilinear (2×2 percentage-closer filtering): `textureSampleCompareLevel(shadow_map, shadow_sampler, p.xy, p.z)` is 1 where the point is lit, 0 in shadow. |
| 7 | `var shadow_map_translucent: texture_depth_2d` | `shadow_map` with the translucent terrain (water, stained glass, ice) the light passes through drawn in too, read with `shadow_sampler` the same way: a point lit in `shadow_map` but not here lies under such a surface, which `shadow_color` gives the colour of. |
| 8 | `var shadow_color: texture_2d<f32>` | The texture colour times the vertex colour (rgb: the tint, the face's directional shade and ambient occlusion) of the nearest translucent surface the light passes through at each texel of `shadow_map_translucent`, white where there is none; alpha is 1 on a fluid (water) and the texture's alpha, at most 0.99, on anything else. Read it with `textureLoad` at `shadow_position`'s xy times `textureDimensions(shadow_color)`. |
| 6 | `var opaque_depth: texture_depth_2d` | The world's depth before translucent terrain (reversed, like `scene_depth`), for the translucent pass: `textureLoad(opaque_depth, vec2<i32>(input.screen * frame.resolution), 0)` is what lies behind water or glass. Stale while solid terrain draws. |
| 9 | `var block_light_colors: texture_3d<f32>` | The colour of the block light around the camera, from the `[[lights]]` of the light sources nearby: rgb their colours averaged by how near each is, over 4; a how strongly they reach the cell. Read it through `block_light_color`. |
| 10 | `var<uniform> block_light_grid: vec4<f32>` | Where `block_light_colors` lies: xyz its corner, camera-relative, w the side of one of its cells in blocks. |
| 11 | `var opaque_color: texture_2d<f32>` | The world's picture before translucent terrain (sky, solid terrain, entities), the size of `opaque_depth`, for the translucent pass: what a surface refracts. Read it with `textureLoad`. Stale while solid terrain draws; black when the world draws straight to the window (a pack without `[[post]]` passes, at full resolution). |

- `fn block_texture_level(uv: vec2<f32>, lod: f32) -> vec4<f32>`: the same at mip level `lod`.
- `fn block_texture_size() -> vec2<f32>`: its size in texels.
- `fn block_texture_lod() -> f32`: the mip level `block_texture` reads at this point.
- `fn block_pbr_maps() -> bool`: whether the resource packs ship LabPBR maps (`_n`, `_s`).
- `fn block_normal_map(uv: vec2<f32>) -> vec4<f32>`: the surface's LabPBR normal map at `uv` (rg the normal along `input.tangent` and down the texture, b ambient occlusion, a height); (0.5, 0.5, 1, 1) without one.
- `fn block_specular_map(uv: vec2<f32>) -> vec4<f32>`: its LabPBR specular map (r smoothness, g F0 or a metal, b porosity or subsurface, a emission, 1 none); (0, 0, 0, 0) without one.
- `fn block_normal_map_level(uv: vec2<f32>, lod: f32) -> vec4<f32>`, `fn block_specular_map_level(uv: vec2<f32>, lod: f32) -> vec4<f32>`: the same at the block texture's mip level `lod`.
- `fn block_pbr_size() -> vec2<f32>`: the LabPBR maps' size in texels.
- `fn set_surface(normal: vec3<f32>, smoothness: f32, data: f32)`: what the post stage's `surface_at` reads for this point of solid terrain (`data` the pack's own; the face's normal and 0, 0 unset).
- `fn shadow_position(position: vec3<f32>) -> vec3<f32>`: where the camera-relative point `position` is
  stored in the shadow map, for `textureSampleCompareLevel`.

### `WeatherInput`

One point of a rain or snow streak, for `fn weather(input: WeatherInput) -> vec4<f32>`, which returns the colour blended over the world (alpha its opacity).

| Field | Type | Meaning |

Resources (bind group 3):

## post

`fn post(input: PostInput) -> vec4<f32>`

### `PostInput`

One pixel of the picture, for `fn post(input: PostInput) -> vec4<f32>`.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `uv` | `vec2<f32>` | Where the pixel is, 0..1 from the top left. |
| `pixel` | `vec2<f32>` | The pixel's centre, in pixels from the top left of what the pass draws (the world's size; the window's for the last pass). |
| `color` | `vec4<f32>` | The previous pass's colour here (the world's picture for the first pass). |
| `depth` | `f32` | The world's depth here, reversed: 0 is the sky. |

Resources (bind group 3):

| Binding | Declaration | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `var<uniform> frame: Frame` | The frame (`Frame`). |
| 1 | `var scene_color: texture_2d<f32>` | The world's picture before any pass. |
| 2 | `var scene_depth: texture_depth_2d` | The world's depth, reversed (1 near, 0 far and sky). |
| 3 | `var previous: texture_2d<f32>` | The previous pass's output (`scene_color` for the first pass). |
| 4 | `var linear_sampler: sampler` | Bilinear filtering, clamped to the edges. |
| 5 | `var nearest_sampler: sampler` | Nearest texel, clamped to the edges. |
| 6 | `var shadow_map: texture_depth_2d` | This frame's shadow map: the depth of the solid terrain and entities the light sees, 0 at the light, 1 away from it (and where nothing is), stored at `shadow_position`'s mapping. Valid while `frame.has_shadow` is 1 (the pack asks for it with `[shadow]`), else a 1×1 map that lights everything. |
| 7 | `var shadow_sampler: sampler_comparison` | Depth comparison, bilinear (2×2 percentage-closer filtering): `textureSampleCompareLevel(shadow_map, shadow_sampler, p.xy, p.z)` is 1 where the point is lit, 0 in shadow. |
| 8 | `var history: texture_2d<f32>` | Last frame's input to the last pass (what the pass before it wrote), for temporal passes (TAA, denoising): put such a pass second to last and it reads its own previous output; reproject with `frame.previous_view_projection`. Black on the first frame, after a gap of over half a second, and with a single pass. |
| 9 | `var shadow_map_translucent: texture_depth_2d` | `shadow_map` with the translucent terrain (water, stained glass, ice) the light passes through drawn in too, read with `shadow_sampler` the same way: a point lit in `shadow_map` but not here lies under such a surface, which `shadow_color` gives the colour of. |
| 10 | `var shadow_color: texture_2d<f32>` | The texture colour times the vertex colour (rgb: the tint, the face's directional shade and ambient occlusion) of the nearest translucent surface the light passes through at each texel of `shadow_map_translucent`, white where there is none; alpha is 1 on a fluid (water) and the texture's alpha, at most 0.99, on anything else. Read it with `textureLoad` at `shadow_position`'s xy times `textureDimensions(shadow_color)`. |
| 11 | `var scene_surface: texture_2d<u32>` | What the material stage's `set_surface` stored for the solid terrain at each pixel, unfiltered (`textureLoad`; its texels are the bits of floats, so `bitcast<vec4<f32>>` them): read it through the prelude's `surface_at`, which knows its layout and where it no longer shows. Blank without a material stage that calls `set_surface`. |

Helpers:

- `fn depth_at(uv: vec2<f32>) -> f32`: the world's depth at `uv`.
- `fn view_position(uv: vec2<f32>, depth: f32) -> vec3<f32>`: the camera-relative position, in blocks, of
  the point at `uv` and `depth`.
- `fn surface_at(texel: vec2<i32>) -> SurfaceData`: the solid terrain's surface at a pixel, as the material stage's `set_surface` left it: `present` (false where the sky, an entity, water, glass or a particle shows instead), `normal` (world axes), `smoothness` and `data`.
- `fn shadow_position(position: vec3<f32>) -> vec3<f32>`: where the camera-relative point `position` is
  stored in the shadow map, for `textureSampleCompareLevel`.
- `fn shadow_distort(xy: vec2<f32>) -> vec2<f32>`: the map's distortion of a point at shadow clip `xy`.

A `[[post]]` entry with `output = "<name>"` writes a target of the pack's own, at its `scale` of the
world's size (1, 0.5 or 0.25), instead of the next pass's `previous`; the prelude of every pass declares
`var <name>: texture_2d<f32>` (group 3 from binding 32), which holds last frame's until written again (a
pass reads a blank one in place of the target it writes).

### Ray tracing

With `[ray_tracing]` in the manifest (it has no keys, and needs a `[[post]]` pass, a `[material]` or an `[entity]`
stage) the post stage's prelude also has `RayHit` and the functions and constants below, so do the material and
entity stages' where their files name one of the four trace functions, and the `Frame` of every stage of the pack
has `has_ray_tracing` and `ray_distance`. A pack without the key has none of them, and a material or entity stage
that names no trace function is built as without it.

- `fn trace(origin: vec3<f32>, direction: vec3<f32>, max_distance: f32) -> RayHit`: the nearest solid surface
  from `origin` (camera-relative, in blocks, as `view_position` gives it) along the unit vector `direction`, within
  `max_distance` blocks.
- `fn trace_any(origin: vec3<f32>, direction: vec3<f32>, max_distance: f32) -> bool`: whether any solid surface
  is in the way: a shadow ray, which stops at the first it finds and reads nothing of it.
- `const RAY_SOLID: u32`, `const RAY_TRANSLUCENT: u32`: the scene's two layers, bits to OR together. Solid
  terrain, with cut-outs (leaves, plants) and lava; and what the translucent pass draws: water, glass, stained
  glass, ice, slime and honey blocks, any block whose texture has partly see-through texels.
- `const RAY_ENTITY: u32`: a third layer, only in a pack whose files name it, anywhere outside a comment (dead
  code too): the entities within the scene's reach, in view or not (behind the camera, hidden), which are mobs,
  players, armour stands, item frames, vehicles, projectiles, falling blocks, block displays, the block entities
  at rest that the block entity cache keeps (on in every graphics preset: closed chests, shulker boxes, bells,
  decorated pots, banners, within vanilla's 64 blocks) in view or not, and the other block entities the camera
  draws (a chest while it opens). Such a pack's `RayHit` also has `entity`. Not in it: particles, text, the hand,
  the camera's own body in first person, translucent items, additive glows, beams and portals, and other block
  entities out of view. `trace` and `trace_any` never read it.
- `fn trace_layers(origin: vec3<f32>, direction: vec3<f32>, max_distance: f32, layers: u32) -> RayHit` and
  `fn trace_any_layers(origin: vec3<f32>, direction: vec3<f32>, max_distance: f32, layers: u32) -> bool`: `trace`
  and `trace_any` over the layers `layers` names; `trace(o, d, m)` is `trace_layers(o, d, m, RAY_SOLID)`. With no
  layer named every ray misses.
- `fn hit_normal_map(hit: RayHit) -> vec4<f32>`, `fn hit_specular_map(hit: RayHit) -> vec4<f32>`: the resource
  packs' LabPBR maps at the hit, its sprite's texel at `hit.uv` at full size, as `block_normal_map_level(uv, 0.0)`
  and `block_specular_map_level(uv, 0.0)` read a drawn surface's; their defaults without maps, and on a miss.
- In the post and entity stages, `fn block_pbr_maps() -> bool`: whether the resource packs ship LabPBR maps, as
  the material stage's.

A ray starts at `origin` itself, so move a point off its own surface before tracing from it. What stops it is what
the surface's own pass draws. In the solid layer it passes through the clear texels of a cut-out texture (leaves,
plants), as terrain's alpha test does: a texel stops it from alpha 0.5 up. In the translucent layer every texel
stops it, however faint, except a clear one (alpha below 0.01), which the translucent pass doesn't draw either;
the hit's `albedo.a` is the texel's alpha and its `translucent` is true. In the entity layer a texel stops it where
vanilla's entity alpha test keeps the pixel, `(texel * tint).a` 0.1 or more (on the dying dragon's dissolve,
vanilla's mask decides), from either side of the face. A ray over several layers stops at the nearest surface of
any: to go on through a translucent one, trace again from just behind the hit. The scene is Horizon's: the
terrain around the camera, out to `frame.ray_distance` at least, without particles, clouds or distant terrain,
and with entities only in `RAY_ENTITY`. While
the game doesn't trace (`frame.has_ray_tracing` is 0) the pack is built and runs all the same, and every ray
misses. Your files name no ray query of their own (`ray_query`, `acceleration_structure`, `RayDesc`,
`RayIntersection`, a `rayQuery` function, `enable wgpu_ray_query`): the check refuses them, and an `output`
named as one of these functions.

In the material stage only `material` traces: `displacement` and the vertex stage's `vertex`, whose files share
its module, run in vertex shaders, and the check refuses a pack where either reaches a trace function.
`material` runs for every terrain fragment drawn, so a ray costs more there than in a post pass: keep its rays for
translucent surfaces (`input.translucent`), which leave no surface for a post pass to light.

In the entity stage `entity` traces as `material` does, in the world's colour pass only (the shadow map's
entities don't run the stage). A ray it casts with `RAY_ENTITY` in its layers can hit the entity it starts on:
move its origin off the surface, as from terrain.

### `RayHit`

The nearest surface along a ray, from `trace` or `trace_layers`. Its `albedo`, `tint`, `light`, `uv`, `material`, `tags`, `emission`, `fluid`, `translucent` and `tangent` are what `MaterialInput` gives the material stage for the same point, so one function can shade both. On a miss `distance` is negative and every other field is 0 (`translucent` false).

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `distance` | `f32` | How far along the ray the surface is, in blocks; negative on a miss. |
| `position` | `vec3<f32>` | The point, camera-relative, in blocks (as `view_position`). |
| `normal` | `vec3<f32>` | The face's normal, a unit vector in world axes, turned toward the ray's origin. |
| `uv` | `vec2<f32>` | The texture coordinate inside the block's sprite (as `MaterialInput.uv`). |
| `albedo` | `vec4<f32>` | The block texture's colour at the point, at full size (mip level 0), linear light; alpha the texture's. |
| `tint` | `vec4<f32>` | The vertex colour: biome tint, face shade and ambient occlusion, linear light; alpha 1. |
| `light` | `vec2<f32>` | Block and sky light, 0..1, smoothed over the face. |
| `material` | `u32` | The `[[materials]]` id of the surface's sprite (0 when no entry names it). |
| `tags` | `u32` | The pack's sprite tags the surface's sprite has: bit i for the manifest's i-th `[[tags]]`. |
| `emission` | `f32` | How strongly the block itself shines, 0..1, by its kind of light: a redstone torch or a candle 7/15, a torch or lava 14/15, glowstone 1; 0 for most blocks (as `MaterialInput.emission`). |
| `fluid` | `u32` | 0 not a fluid, 1 water, 2 lava (as `MaterialInput.fluid`). Water is in the `RAY_TRANSLUCENT` layer, lava in `RAY_SOLID`. |
| `translucent` | `bool` | A surface of the translucent pass (water, stained glass, ice), as `MaterialInput.translucent`: a hit in the `RAY_TRANSLUCENT` layer, so false for every hit of `trace`. |
| `entity` | `bool` | Only in a pack whose files name `RAY_ENTITY`: a hit in that layer, an entity's surface. Its `albedo` is the entity texture's texel and `tint`, `light` and `uv` are its vertices' (the colour vanilla multiplies in, alpha included; the atlas position); `material`, `tags`, `emission` and `fluid` are 0, `hit_normal_map` and `hit_specular_map` give their defaults. |
| `tangent` | `vec4<f32>` | The surface's tangent, as `MaterialInput.tangent`: xyz the unit direction in world axes along which `uv.x` grows, w the sign (1 or -1) that makes `cross(normal, tangent.xyz) * tangent.w` the direction `uv.y` grows along (down the texture). It follows `normal`, which faces the ray's origin. With `normal` it turns `hit_normal_map`'s normals into world axes. |
| `horizon_sprite` | `u32` | Horizon's own: where the hit's sprite is kept, for `hit_normal_map` and `hit_specular_map`. Not for packs to read; it changes with the renderer. |

Bindings 48 to 59 of group 3 hold the scene while the game traces (60 to
63 the entity layer, for a pack that names it), and in a post pass bindings 12 and 13 the LabPBR maps (the
material and entity stages have them there already). They are Horizon's, as their `horizon_` names say, and change with the
renderer.

## tonemap

`fn tonemap(input: TonemapInput) -> vec3<f32>`

### `TonemapInput`

One pixel of an output (the window), for `fn tonemap(input: TonemapInput) -> vec3<f32>`, which returns its colour for the output `frame` describes: linear light, 1.0 at paper white, from 0 to `frame.headroom` (Horizon clamps it there).

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `uv` | `vec2<f32>` | Where the pixel is, 0..1 from the top left. |
| `pixel` | `vec2<f32>` | The pixel's centre, in pixels from the top left of the output (the window). |
| `color` | `vec3<f32>` | The post chain's picture here (the world's without one), linear light, never negative or NaN. |

Resources (bind group 3):

| Binding | Declaration | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `var<uniform> frame: Frame` | The frame (`Frame`). |
| 3 | `var previous: texture_2d<f32>` | The post chain's picture at the window's size (without a post chain, the world's at the world's size), linear light: what `input.color` samples, for a curve that reads around the pixel. |
| 4 | `var linear_sampler: sampler` | Bilinear filtering, clamped to the edges. |
| 5 | `var nearest_sampler: sampler` | Nearest texel, clamped to the edges. |

It is a pure mapping from the scene's light to the output its `frame` describes, run once per pixel of
each output, after the post chain and before the camera overlays and the HUD. Today the display is the
only output; Horizon may add others for the same frame, such as an SDR screenshot or icon, where `frame`'s
display fields describe SDR (`hdr` 0, `headroom` 1, `paper_white` and `peak` 80, `black_level` 0). Its
only output is the colour it returns, so nothing carries from one call to the next. A pack without it gets
Horizon's: a clip at white in SDR, and in HDR the curve Horizon uses without a pack, which keeps light up
to 60% of the peak as it is and rolls it off into the peak above. Either runs once: Horizon doesn't map a pack's
result again. Horizon holds the result to 0 to `frame.headroom`, then lifts the shadows onto
`frame.black_level`.

## entity

`fn entity(input: EntityInput) -> Surface`

### `EntityInput`

One point of the surface of an entity, a block entity, an item or a particle, for `fn entity(input: EntityInput) -> Surface`.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `albedo` | `vec4<f32>` | The texture's colour here. |
| `tint` | `vec4<f32>` | The vertex colour without vanilla's directional shade (dyes, particle colours, fades). |
| `overlay` | `vec4<f32>` | The flash vanilla lays over the surface (hurt, TNT, a creeper's swelling): rgb its colour, alpha how much of the surface it replaces. Alpha 0 without one. |
| `lightmap` | `vec3<f32>` | Vanilla's light colour for `light` this frame. |
| `shade` | `f32` | Vanilla's directional shade for this face as a factor on linear light, 0..1 (vanilla's value decoded with the 2.2 power, as every 0.2 colour is). 1 where vanilla applies none. |
| `position` | `vec3<f32>` | The point, camera-relative, in blocks. |
| `emission` | `f32` | 1 on a layer vanilla draws at full brightness (spider and enderman eyes, the warden's glow), else 0. There `lightmap` is full light; `shade` stays vanilla's, which shades the warden's glow and not the eyes. |
| `normal` | `vec3<f32>` | The surface's geometric normal, a unit vector in world axes, facing the camera, from the position's screen derivatives (as `MaterialInput.normal`, without its snap to the axes). |
| `kind` | `u32` | What is drawn: 0 an entity (mobs, players, armour, vehicles), 1 a block entity (chests, banners, bells, shulker boxes), 2 a dropped or framed item, 3 reserved for the first-person hand, 4 a particle. |
| `colored_light` | `vec3<f32>` | As `MaterialInput.colored_light`: the frame's coloured lights at this point, 0..1; 0 where none reaches. |
| `translucent` | `bool` | Drawn with blending. |
| `light` | `vec2<f32>` | Block and sky light, 0..1. |
| `uv` | `vec2<f32>` | The texture coordinate. |
| `screen` | `vec2<f32>` | Where the point is on the screen, 0..1 from the top left (as `MaterialInput.screen`). |

`entity` lights what is no block terrain: `input.kind` says which. It returns the same `Surface` as `material` (rgb
linear light, 0 or more and unbounded; alpha its coverage), so a pack writes its lighting once and calls it from both
stages. Around it Horizon keeps vanilla's order: the alpha test on the returned alpha, then the enchantment glint
added on top, then fog. A pack without `[entity]` is drawn as before, and sees none of this stage's names; the rule
for new names holds for the stage as for the others.

**What the game draws through the stage so far: entities and block entities** (`kind` 0 and 1). Until a later
release brings them in, Horizon lights the rest itself, exactly as without the stage: dropped and framed items and
what a block or a display entity shows of one (`kind` 2), what flies as its item (a snowball, a potion, a fireball,
an eye of ender), firework rockets, particles (`kind` 4), the fire on a burning entity, a guardian's beam, a lead's
rope, name tags and text, and the first-person hand. Some draws stay Horizon's for good: beacon beams, the beams of
End crystals, End portals and gateways, breaking cracks, energy swirls, lightning and other additive glows.

An item an entity holds or wears as its model (a sword in a hand, a block on a head) reaches the stage with the
entity, unless its texture has see-through pixels (stained glass, ice, a slime block): that one is drawn with the
translucent items, and stays Horizon's until items draw through the stage. A block drawn as an entity (a falling
block, primed TNT, a block display) or as a block entity (a block a piston moves) reaches the stage too. These have
vanilla's shade already in `tint`, and `shade` 1: their vertices carry the two as one colour so far. A sign's board
and a bed are block terrain, the material stage's.

Vanilla's own, the picture a pack without the stage gets:

```wgsl
fn entity(input: EntityInput) -> Surface {
    let base = input.albedo.rgb * input.tint.rgb * input.shade;
    // Vanilla lays the flash over the surface in its gamma (the 2.2 power), before the light.
    let gamma = vec3<f32>(1.0 / 2.2);
    let flashed = pow(mix(pow(base, gamma), pow(input.overlay.rgb, gamma), input.overlay.a), vec3<f32>(2.2));
    return Surface(vec4<f32>(flashed * input.lightmap, input.albedo.a * input.tint.a));
}
```

Without a flash (`overlay.a` 0) that is `albedo * tint * shade * lightmap`. In linear light alone,
`mix(base, input.overlay.rgb, input.overlay.a) * input.lightmap` is the same flash a little brighter. The shade and
the light act on rgb only. `lightmap` holds no coloured light: where `colored_light` is above 0, Horizon's own draw
adds it to the light colour, and the expression above leaves it out.

Resources (bind group 3):

| Binding | Declaration | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `var<uniform> frame: Frame` | The frame (`Frame`). |
| 2 | `var block_light_sampler: sampler` | Bilinear filtering, clamped to the edges: what `block_light_color` reads `block_light_colors` with. |
| 3 | `var shadow_map: texture_depth_2d` | This frame's shadow map: the depth of the solid terrain and entities the light sees, 0 at the light, 1 away from it (and where nothing is), stored at `shadow_position`'s mapping. Valid while `frame.has_shadow` is 1 (the pack asks for it with `[shadow]`), else a 1×1 map that lights everything. |
| 4 | `var shadow_sampler: sampler_comparison` | Depth comparison, bilinear (2×2 percentage-closer filtering): `textureSampleCompareLevel(shadow_map, shadow_sampler, p.xy, p.z)` is 1 where the point is lit, 0 in shadow. |
| 7 | `var shadow_map_translucent: texture_depth_2d` | `shadow_map` with the translucent terrain (water, stained glass, ice) the light passes through drawn in too, read with `shadow_sampler` the same way: a point lit in `shadow_map` but not here lies under such a surface, which `shadow_color` gives the colour of. |
| 8 | `var shadow_color: texture_2d<f32>` | The texture colour times the vertex colour (rgb: the tint, the face's directional shade and ambient occlusion) of the nearest translucent surface the light passes through at each texel of `shadow_map_translucent`, white where there is none; alpha is 1 on a fluid (water) and the texture's alpha, at most 0.99, on anything else. Read it with `textureLoad` at `shadow_position`'s xy times `textureDimensions(shadow_color)`. |
| 9 | `var block_light_colors: texture_3d<f32>` | The colour of the block light around the camera, from the `[[lights]]` of the light sources nearby: rgb their colours averaged by how near each is, over 4; a how strongly they reach the cell. Read it through `block_light_color`. |
| 10 | `var<uniform> block_light_grid: vec4<f32>` | Where `block_light_colors` lies: xyz its corner, camera-relative, w the side of one of its cells in blocks. |

Helpers:

- `fn block_light_color(position: vec3<f32>) -> vec4<f32>`: the colour of the block light at the camera-relative `position` (rgb) and how strongly it reaches it (a), as the material stage's.
- `fn shadow_position(position: vec3<f32>) -> vec3<f32>`: where the camera-relative point `position` is
  stored in the shadow map, for `textureSampleCompareLevel`.
- `fn shadow_distort(xy: vec2<f32>) -> vec2<f32>`: the map's distortion of a point at shadow clip `xy`.

## The frame

### `Frame`

The frame, as `frame` in every stage. Positions and directions are in world axes relative to the camera (x east, y up, z south), so they stay precise far from the world's origin; depth is reversed (1 near, 0 at the far plane and in the sky).

This frame's on the first frame and after a gap of over half a second (a pause, a world load), when last frame's camera says nothing about this one. |

| `delta_time` | `f32` | 492 | Seconds since last frame (0 on the first and after such a gap). |
| `eye_light_smooth` | `vec2<f32>` | 496 | `eye_light` eased with a half-life of 2 seconds: it follows the light levels' steps without stepping itself (for exposure and indoor fog). |

| `shadow_distortion` | `f32` | 740 | How strongly the shadow map is distorted toward its centre, 0..1: a point at shadow clip `xy` is stored at `xy / (length(xy) * k + 1 - k)`, so texels near the camera cover less ground (`shadow_position` applies it). |
| `shadow_resolution` | `f32` | 744 | The shadow map's side, in texels; 0 without a shadow map. |

## Anti-aliasing

While a pack's `[[post]]` chain draws the frame, the player's anti-aliasing settings do not run: `taa`, `fxaa`
and `upscaling` in `horizon-graphics.txt` have no effect, and the frame's projection is never jittered, because the
last post pass draws the picture itself and Horizon's own resolve, which does TAA, FXAA and TAA upscaling, is the
step it replaces. The world is still rendered at `resolutionScale` before the pack reads it.

A pack that wants smooth edges draws them itself, in a post pass: a spatial filter (FXAA, SMAA and the like) works on
`previous` as it is. A temporal pass cannot do what TAA does here, even though `history` and
`frame.previous_view_projection` give it the last frame: nothing moves the camera by a fraction of a texel from one
frame to the next, so a still camera gives it the same picture twice and there is no sub-pixel detail to gather.

Without a pack the settings apply as the player set them.

## Options

Each `[[options]]` entry sets the WGSL `override` of the same name when the pipelines are built:

| `type` | Keys | The `override` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bool` | `default` | `override <id>: bool` |
| `float` | `default`, `min`, `max`, `step` | `override <id>: f32` |
| `int` | `default`, `min`, `max` | `override <id>: i32` |
| `choice` | `values`, `default` (one of them) | `override <id>: u32`, the value's index |

## Limits

- 12 post passes, 64 options, `budget.gpu_ms` up to 16.
- 256 KiB per WGSL file, 8 MiB per pack.
- Per stage: 20000 naga expressions over all its functions, 64 texture reads (samples,
  gathers and loads, the prelude's included).

## The check

A pack runs only after it passes `horizon_shader_api::check` (the game when it loads a pack, the launcher before it
installs one, the registry's CI): each stage is parsed and validated by naga, checked against its signature and
the rules above, and translated for Vulkan (SPIR-V), Metal and DirectX 12 (HLSL) with its options at their
defaults, minimums and maximums. Every option must be an `override` of its type in some stage; an `override`
that is no option needs a default.
